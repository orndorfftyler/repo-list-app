# repo-list-app

[https://orndorfftyler.github.io/repo-list-app/](https://orndorfftyler.github.io/repo-list-app/)

This app lets the user view the repos hosted on GitHub associated with a particular user. This helped me practice making API calls. An error message is displayed if the API response is not successful (status not in the range 200-299).

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
